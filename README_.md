# Summary Report on Foodborne Disease Outbreaks

A foodborne disease outbreak is defined as two or more cases of similar illnesses caused by the same agent (e.g., a toxin, virus or bacteria), which are linked to the same food source. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from USA estimates that each year roughly 1 in 6 Americans (or 48 million people) get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases. However, only a small percentage of those cases are related to a foodborne disease outbreak. Additionally, **it is thought that the number of foodborne illnesses reported to the health department is much less than the actual number of illnesses that occur every year** (http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/environmental-health/food-safety-in-virginia/foodborne-diseases-and-outbreaks/foodborne-outbreaks/).

The collection of data on foodborne outbreaks is imperative to identify the pathogen and the food vehicle involved, providing relevant information to monitor the prevalence of foodborne disease. In addition, such data contribute to evaluate trends and can provide the basis for regulatory changes and public health actions to improve food safety and reduce illness and death caused by foodborne diseases.

The dataset, found on CDC, provides data on foodborne disease outbreaks reported from 1998 to 2015.

The data fields include year, state, location where the food was prepared, reported food vehicle and contaminated ingredient, etiology (the pathogen, toxin, or chemical that caused the illnesses), status (whether the etiology was confirmed or suspected), total illnesses, hospitalizations and fatalities.

**Objective**: Verify the quality of the dataset (dimensions of data quality), as well as explore the dataset in order to identify the main causative agents, foodstuffs and locations implicated in the foodborne disease outbreak episodes.

This project is an initial analysis (version 1). Further analysis, including statistical evaluation and predictive modeling, requires a deep data wrangling and will be performed later.
